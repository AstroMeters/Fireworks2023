# Project: Measurement of optical spectras from fireworks

> [!NOTE]
> The first measerument was conducted during the New Year's Eve 2023. Project is currently in early stage of data analysis.

## Introduction

Fireworks, while visually stunning, pose significant risks to the environment and human health. They release various chemicals, including heavy metals that can be toxic. This exposure can lead to health issues like respiratory problems and long-term health impacts.

In addition to health risks, fireworks negatively impact air quality. High levels of airborne particles in the air are often recorded after fireworks shows, highlighting their significant effect. Unlike emissions from industrial processes or vehicles, 
the control over these emissions is limited.

## Experiment
Our experiment conducted on New Year's Eve 2023 in Prague aimed to identify elements in fireworks using spectral analysis.
The following goal of this experiment was to validate whether optical spectra of fireworks can be measured using this method, we also wanted to know what is needed for such measurements and what kind of results we might expect.
Additionally, we wanted identify any issues inherent in this approach and propose potential improvements for future measurements.

The setup was strategically placed in higher floors of tower-building in Prague housing estate for optimal viewing and data capture. We conducted capturing diverse spectra representing different chemical elements used in the publicly-availible fireworks.

## Aparature
![EOSR0971](https://github.com/roman-dvorak/Fireworks2023/assets/5196729/b99c4376-7233-4b5c-962b-cb13943ac42c)

The setup was assembled using equipment available to us, allowing the measurement to be conducted without the need for purchasing expensive gear.

- **500/80 ED Telescope**: An optical device with an 80 mm lens diameter and 500 mm focal length, optimized for capturing clear, detailed images.
- **Spectral Grating 100 lines per millimeter**: Separates light into individual spectral lines for chemical element identification.
- **Monochromatic High-Speed Camera**: Records 1000-800 frames per second, important for capturing fast-moving pyrotechnic events.
- **Tripod**: A sturdy tripod under the telescope allowing for quick aiming of the setup.
- **Finder Scope**: A device for quickly aiming the telescope.
- **Computer with sufficient storage capacity**: The camera produces a large amount of data; a 6-second recording is approximately 7 GB. Data was immediately uploaded via network to the connected computer.


## RAW data availability
The RAW data, totaling around 150GB, are available upon request due to their large size. This data includes complete spectral information captured during the experiment.
