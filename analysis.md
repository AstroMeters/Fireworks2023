### Sodium (Na)
After plotting all spectra in a single graph, a significant and common peak at a wavelength of 587 nm is observed. According to the NIST spectral database, sodium has a very prominent doublet of emission lines at 588.9 and 589.5 nm, which corresponds quite accurately with the detected wavelength.
